# How has the relationship between total agricultural land use and arable land share evolved in Benin between 1962 and 2022?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), this study examines the evolution of agricultural land use and arable land share in Benin between 1962 and 2022. Over this sixty-year period, both indicators increased steadily, reflecting the country’s gradual expansion of land devoted to agriculture. However, arable land — which measures land suitable for crop cultivation — consistently remained about five percentage points below total agricultural land, suggesting that a portion of agricultural land is used for non-arable purposes such as pasture or permanent crops. These parallel yet distinct trajectories reveal a stable long-term relationship, highlighting how Benin’s agricultural landscape has expanded without major shifts in land-use composition.

## 1. Question

How has the relationship between total agricultural land use and arable land share evolved in Benin between 1962 and 2022?

- **Agricultural land proxy**: Agricultural land (% of land area)
- **Arable land proxy**: Arable land (% of land area)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Agricultural land (% of land area)
  - Arable land (% of land area)
- **Coverage**: Benin, 1962–2022
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Benin.
2. **Selected relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted agricultural and arable land indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a dual-axis line graph comparing trends in total agricultural land and arable land.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Agricultural land (% of land area)**: Increased steadily from 1962 to 2022, indicating a gradual intensification of land use for agricultural purposes.
- **Arable land (% of land area)**: Followed a nearly identical upward trend, though consistently about five percentage points lower, reflecting stable structural differences in land use types.
- **Comparison**: Both indicators rose significantly over time, maintaining a near-constant gap, suggesting balanced growth across both arable and broader agricultural uses.

## 5. Interpretation

- Benin’s long-term increase in both agricultural and arable land shares reflects sustained expansion in agricultural activity, possibly driven by population growth and rural livelihoods.
- The consistent gap between the two measures suggests that land-use diversification — including livestock, permanent crops, or mixed farming systems — has remained structurally stable over decades.
- These patterns highlight a balanced but slow-moving agricultural transformation, where overall land use expands without major shifts in the type or intensity of cultivation.

## 6. Limitations

- The analysis does not distinguish between land productivity, crop yield, or soil quality changes over time.
- National-level data may obscure regional variations in land use, degradation, or urban encroachment.
- Descriptive analysis does not assess causal factors such as climate, population pressure, or policy interventions.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Examine regional land-use data to identify areas of expansion, stagnation, or degradation.
- Link land-use trends with agricultural output and rural employment statistics.
- Compare Benin’s agricultural land dynamics with other West African countries to identify shared regional patterns.
- Investigate the role of agricultural policy, climate adaptation, and land tenure reforms in shaping long-term land use.
